This is repo containing all advanced De Novo peptide sequencing models developed by us.

It includes:

1. RefineNovo: an ultra-stable NAT model framework that can adapt to any data distributions. (most stable training so far, guaranteed successful training)

2. PrimeNovo: First NAT biological sequences model for fast sequencing.

3. ContraNovo: Autoregressive multimodal contrastive learning model for de novo sequencing.

4. RankNovo: A framework for combining any set of de novo models for combined power of accurate predictions

6. crossNovo: A unified model combining knowledge learnt from both NAT and AT model (best single-model performance so far)

7. Reflection based model: a model that allows for CoT and self-correction.
