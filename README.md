# 📃Overview

This is repo containing all advanced De Novo peptide sequencing models developed by Beam Lab.

It includes:

| Model | Category | Brief Introduction |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ContraNovo | AT |  Autoregressive multimodal contrastive learning model for de novo sequencing. |
| PrimeNovo | NAT | First NAT biological sequences model for fast sequencing. |
| RefineNovo | NAT | An ultra-stable NAT model framework that can adapt to any data distributions. (most stable training so far, guaranteed successful training). |
| RankNovo | NAT | A framework for combining any set of de novo models for combined power of accurate predictions. |
| CrossNovo | AT | A unified model combining knowledge learnt from both NAT and AT model (best single-model performance so far). |
| Reflection based model | AT | A model that allows for CoT and self-correction (human interferability). |

(N)AT refers to (Non)-Autoregressive Transformer.
